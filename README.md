# bluetoothping
A simple data logging program that we built for our California Science Fair Project (2017). To roughly estimate the radiation patterns of different Bluetooth antennas, we wrote a simple script to test signal strength at given angles and log the data in CSV files to generate polar-plot patterns in Microsoft Excel.

The ping.py program utilizes hcitools' rssi command, written by Maxim Krasnyansky and Marcel Holtmann.


The various .csv files contain our data that was used in the science project.
